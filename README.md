# Where does the name Nike-Zues come from?
>"Nike Zeus was an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system developed by the United States Army during the late 1950s and early 1960s that was designed to >destroy incoming Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile warheads before they could hit their targets"
>In our case the Soviet ICBM's are spam bots infiltrating GroupMe servers

## Why even impliment such a system when a simple key word searching bot is good enough?
>Good enough is alright but we want the ability for a system to learn and change, even a flawed adaptive system is better than none at all.
